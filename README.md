# spaceinvaders
A Processing project about space invaders-like game


This repository has been created in order to use GitHub. The game, inside of it, is a clone influenced by the famous space invaders, realised using Processing.org. Because of the fact that we consider it as a test, we don't officially don't keep it or to make it better, leaving our work free and accessible to everyone, who would like to use it.
